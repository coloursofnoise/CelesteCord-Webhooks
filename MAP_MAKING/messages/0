**Welcome to <#429775352295063563>!
This is a space for anything mapping related, be it asking for help, feedback, or just showing your stuff off.**

**To install Ahorn (the map editor), download [Olympus](<https://everestapi.github.io/>) and head to the Ahorn tab. From there you'll be able install it, and set config options such as theme.**

You can also check out [**LÃ¶nn**](<https://github.com/CelestialCartographers/Loenn>), the in-development replacement to Ahorn.

Note that bugs are to be expected - if you find any, make sure to ping <@&683773388321456184> with relevant information.

Before asking any questions, **please read the [Ahorn README](<https://github.com/CelestialCartographers/Ahorn>) and [Mapping FAQ](<https://github.com/EverestAPI/Resources/wiki/Mapping-FAQ>)**, which contain keybinds for different actions and general instructions/info on both Ahorn and mapping.

For more information on adding and configuring features to your map, you can look through the [Everest Wiki](<https://github.com/EverestAPI/Resources/wiki>) as a whole.

There is also [Documentation for Vanilla Entities](<https://github.com/EverestAPI/Resources/wiki/Entity-and-Trigger-Documentation>) and a [Custom Entity List](<https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/custom-entity-catalog>) that includes links to mod-specific documentation and shows which editor(s) each entity supports.
Additional mod documentation may be available on the [Mod Resources Wiki](<https://github.com/EverestAPI/ModResources/wiki>).

If you have any further questions, feel free to ask! There is lots of documentation in wikis, pins, gamebanana pages, and editor tooltips, but if you're still stuck people are happy to help out.
