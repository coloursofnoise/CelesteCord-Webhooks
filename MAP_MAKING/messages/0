**Welcome to <#429775352295063563>!
This is a space for anything mapping related, be it asking for help, feedback, or just showing your stuff off.**

**To install Lönn (the map editor), follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/CelestialCartographers/Loenn/#installation).**

You'll also want to download [Olympus](https://everestapi.github.io/) to install the Everest mod loader.

Note that bugs are to be expected - if you find any, make sure to ping <@&683773388321456184> with relevant information.

Before asking any questions, **please read the [Lönn README](<https://github.com/CelestialCartographers/Loenn>) and [Mapping FAQ](<https://github.com/EverestAPI/Resources/wiki/Mapping-FAQ>)**, which contain keybinds for different actions and general instructions/info on both Lönn and mapping.

For more information on adding and configuring features to your map, you can look through the [Everest Wiki](<https://github.com/EverestAPI/Resources/wiki>) as a whole.

There is also [Documentation for Vanilla Entities](<https://github.com/EverestAPI/Resources/wiki/Entity-and-Trigger-Documentation>) and a [Custom Entity List](<https://maddie480.ovh/celeste/custom-entity-catalog>) that includes links to mod-specific documentation and shows which editor(s) each entity supports.
Additional mod documentation may be available on the [Mod Resources Wiki](<https://github.com/EverestAPI/ModResources/wiki>).

[Community Playtesting Server](<https://discord.gg/pmauV7EyMs>) - A server designed for finding playtesters for upcoming maps you are making and getting feedback on any celeste mod you are making.

If you have any further questions, feel free to ask! There is lots of documentation in wikis, pins, gamebanana pages, and editor tooltips, but if you're still stuck people are happy to help out.
