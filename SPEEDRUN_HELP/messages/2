**__Question Guidelines__**
Before asking a question, please try to follow these guidelines so that you can be helped more efficiently.

**Try and answer your question yourself.**
Questions like "How do I do this room fast" or "What are some good strats here" can be answered with some research: watch runs at your goal time on the leaderboards, experiment in-game to try learn those strats, and then ask for help with further struggles. Community resources (check the pinned messages here and in <#407934733595705344>) may also contain the answers you're looking for, so make sure to reference those as well.

**Be specific.**
Vague questions like "How do I get X time", "I can't get this strat to work" or "Is this good" are difficult to answer due to being so broad. Take the time to identify specific things you're struggling with or what you need advice on. Some examples include how to control your movement better, poor consistency with Summit, not getting speed on an ultra, or strat recommendations that are faster/more consistent. Include those details in your question.

**Provide a video clip to support your question.**
When asking for help with performing a strat or improving execution, including a clip of attempts makes it easier to identify and rectify mistakes.

**Include your current/goal time to contextualise your question.**
This ensures you receive advice relevant to your needs. Celeste's skill range is massive, so advice given to a high level runner may not be appropriate for a newer runner.

**Make sure your question is relevant to speedrunning Celeste.**
