**Welcome to the speedrunning category!**

Please read and follow the server <#409439815835189248>. In particular, observe rules 9 and 10 when commenting on others' PBs or posting your own, and avoid making comments that promote unwelcome competition between community members. Examples of discouraged behavior include: pinging others when posting PBs, placing others on a pedestal through unwanted idolization, and comments such as "you beat me" or "bopped me"; please keep this behavior to DMs with friends.
