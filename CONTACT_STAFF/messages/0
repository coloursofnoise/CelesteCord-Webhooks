If you would like to talk to the mod team privately, click the `ðŸ“© Create ticket` button on the message above and it'll open a temporary private channel with only you and the mod team. This can be used to report another user, to appeal server warns and mutes, or any other reason you may need to contact the mod team. If you need help with celeste or celeste modding, please use <#666197738026827786> or <#953393160464269402> instead. As the tickets are temporary and will be deleted afterwards, if you would like a transcript of the conversation for logging purposes please feel free to ask a moderator at any time and we will be able to provide that for you.

Please do not open non-serious tickets, as they will be deleted and you will be warned.
