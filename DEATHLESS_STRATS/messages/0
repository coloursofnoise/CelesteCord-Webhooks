When posting to this channel, your post must contain a permanent link to a video or image clearly depicting a strat, additional description explaining the strat, and some descriptive tags from the following categories:

1. Name of the map pack (#vanilla, #glyph, #sc, etc.)
2. In multi-chapter packs, shorthand chapter name (#1a, #winterside, #fota, etc.)
3. In longer chapters, checkpoint name is strongly encouraged (#2.5k, #dt, #memories, etc.)
4. Category/additional context (#fc, #mb, #dashless, etc.)

You should also make sure to check that you:
- Remove spaces in tags, as this breaks the search function.
- Disable skin mods that significantly affect visual clarity of a strat.
- Avoid sites like streamable.com that purge the video after a while.
- Delete the `user created a thread` messages when you start a thread.

Some other general etiquette that is recommended is to:
- Enable photosensitive mode and disable screenshake, particularly for high intensity maps.
- Avoid capital letters in tag names if possible.
- Check that you're using the common tags if you're posting a mod strat.
