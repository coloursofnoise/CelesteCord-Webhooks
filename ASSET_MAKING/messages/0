**Welcome to <#696801669517672658>!**
**This is a place for Spriters and Musicians to discuss asset creation for Celeste mods, and to showcase what they've made.**

Mappers, if you want to use an asset in your map, **ask for permission first**. Spriters/Musicians, if your work is freely usable by anyone, please tag it as such.

General information on Tilesets, FMOD and other guides for asset creation can be found under the Graphics and Audio sections of the [Everest Wiki](<https://github.com/EverestAPI/Resources/wiki>) respectively.

Download the [Vanilla Graphics Dump](<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ITwCI2uJ7YflAG0OwBR4uOUEJBjwTCet/view>) for version 1.4.0.0, structured in the same way as vanilla.

For custom sprites, check out the [Community Asset Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13A0feEXS3kUHb_Q4K2w4xP8DEuBlgTip?usp=sharing), full of tilesets, decals, and more for modders to use. If you want to contribute yourself, ping or DM @Gamation, @.spooooky, @maddie480, @helpful.deer.thoughts, or @under_dragon.

If you're just getting started (or just want to up your game), you can also have a look at Pedro's (the spriter for Celeste) amazing [Pixel Art Tutorials](<https://lospec.com/pixel-art-tutorials/author/pedro-medeiros>).

Musicians, you can download the FMOD project for Celeste from the [FMOD Downloads page](<https://www.fmod.com/download#learningresources>), under learning resources. Make sure to read the [Documentation and EULA](<https://www.fmod.com/resources/documentation-studio?version=2.01&page=appendix-a-celeste.html>).

If you're interested in starting a skin mod, you can use the [SkinMod Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yQpj05TaNuI5rfxF4zCfg8Z9oX_XzihGwm94D2t5ZkE) created by <@196034997507981313> to track your progress.
