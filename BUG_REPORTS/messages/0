This channel has been locked to moderators only to reduce the amount of repeat and hardware-related reports.

To report a *vanilla* bug, please contact a <@&878878675423096852> or <@&673384065327431700> to ensure that it can be properly replicated and is not already patched.

For hardware related crashes or other issues involving installing and running the game, ask in <#666197738026827786> (be sure to check the pins).
For bugs encountered while playing with mods installed, see <#514006912115802113>.

Please include your `error_log.txt` and (if modded) `log.txt`, as well as how you encountered the error so that it is easier to diagnose. These can be found in the main Celeste install folder, or in Celesteâ€™s saves folder (platform dependent).
