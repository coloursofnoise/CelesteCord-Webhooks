As with everywhere on Discord, you must follow the rules outlined in the Discord ToS (<https://dis.gd/terms>) and Community Guidelines (<https://dis.gd/guidelines>).

1. Don't be a jerk, racist, sexist, or discriminate. Don't use phrases including words such as "gay", "retarded", "virgin" as a slur or in any way that discriminates against a specific group of people, even when not used to refer to those groups. Changing the word in an attempt to bypass this rule (e.g "soft a" instead of "hard r") is prohibited.

2. No lewd, gore, NSFW, or malicious content. This includes images and discussion of such topics. If what you're posting isn't PG-13 or lower, it doesn't belong here. Malicious content includes images/videos with the purpose of scaring people or crashing applications.

3. Don't cause drama. This includes discussion about politics, religion, gossip about other players, and any other controversial topics, as they often cause unnecessary arguments.

4. No spamming. This includes, but is not limited to, posting chains of emotes, unnecessary spoiler tags, and gibberish.

5. No advertising, including self promotion and discord invites. If your advertisement is related to Celeste and the community, you may DM a moderator for permission to post it.

6. Do not vent or make the general topic of discussion about your life problems or actions of self harm.
If you are having thoughts about self harm it is important to talk to someone trained to help you, so be sure to look into local resources for people who can help you help yourself.

7. No warez, piracy, or malware.
Discussion about emulation and emulators is allowed. However, pointing to where to download or redistributing copyrighted material without permission, in particular Celeste itself, is prohibited.
