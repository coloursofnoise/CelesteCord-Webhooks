**Welcome to the Mt. Celeste Climbing Association!** As with everywhere on Discord, you must follow the rules outlined in the Discord [Terms of Service](<https://dis.gd/terms>) and [Community Guidelines](<https://dis.gd/guidelines>), as well as the following server rules:

1. Don't harass or discriminate against others, including using slurs or words in any way that puts down a specific group of people, even when not used to refer to those groups. Changing or censoring a banned word in an attempt to bypass this rule is prohibited.

2. No NSFW, disturbing, or malicious content, including media and discussion of such content. Keep in mind that this is a 13+ server, so your content should remain appropriate for all users. Malicious content includes media with the intent of crashing, very fast gifs which could cause photosensitivity issues, or otherwise compromising software.

3. Don't cause or contribute to drama. This includes discussion about politics, religion, gossip about other people, and any other controversial topics, as they often cause unnecessary arguments.

4. No spamming, such as posting chains of emotes, gifs, unnecessary spoiler tags, excessively long text, and gibberish.

5. No advertising, including self promotion and Discord invites. If your advertisement is related to Celeste and the community, you may open a ticket in <#962025876407590912> for permission to post it.

6. Do not vent or make the general topic of discussion about your life problems or actions of self harm.
If you are having thoughts about self harm it is important to talk to someone trained to help you, so be sure to look into local resources for people who can help you help yourself.
