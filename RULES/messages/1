8. Be respectful and understanding of others, and avoid making people uncomfortable or otherwise ruining their fun. We all get upset at times, but negativity should stay at a reasonable level, as it drains everyone else.

9. If someone is posting a pb/accomplishment in gaming or life, either congratulate them or keep silent, unless constructive criticism or feedback is requested. No one is claiming that their achievements are unbeatable, anything could be faster, so this doesn't need to be stated.

10. Community members should strive to make others feel comfortable with their achievements without pushing them to do more beyond that. Peer pressure, valuing others' personal achievements/feelings as less than yours, or one-upping others with mentions aren't allowed.

11. User profiles, including but not limited to Username, Nickname, and Profile Picture are subject to moderation in accordance to the rules, in particular rules 1 and 2.

12. Don't post significant spoilers (spoiling story, plot twists, etc.) for newly released content or media (games, movies, etc.) without utilising spoiler tags and tagging the content appropriately.

13. The devs are busy people, don't ping them or waste their time. This rule is applicable everywhere, including in <#407055931138899969>.

14. You may disagree with the mods/admins, but do it politely and constructively. We're at over ~~9200~~ ~~16000~~ 25000 members and it's a lot of work for them that they aren't getting paid for.

15. Please use only English for conversations. All users in this server understand English, and speaking in other languages will exclude the vast majority of other users. If you want to talk with someone in a different language, please use DMs.
