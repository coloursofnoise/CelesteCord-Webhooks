If you feel the need to report anyone in the server (including members of the staff team) for whatever reason without directly messaging a moderator, you may either:
- Use the **[Celestecord Report Service](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdS313fobbfUxKQOHgoTLRbK-TR9PdkWH3ZjPp9s9lTGavHgg/viewform?usp=sf_link)** to fill out and send a (optionally anonymous) report to us.
- Open a ticket in <#962025876407590912> to directly discuss it with the team.

Ban appeals can be submitted through this form if needed. Bookmarking or otherwise saving it elsewhere is recommended.
