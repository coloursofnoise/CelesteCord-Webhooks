15. Please only use English for conversations, as extended discussion in other languages is difficult to moderate - isolated words or phrases in other languages are fine, but if you plan on having a conversation in one move to DMs instead.

Media and Voice Chat permissions will be granted via the `media` role. Specifics on how it's given out will not be stated publicly, due to the nature of what of what we are trying to prevent. To get the role, you will simply have to be active on the server. All users who were here before the implementation of this rule should get the role really fast.

If you feel the need to report anyone in the server (including members of the staff team) for whatever reason without directly messaging a moderator, you may either:
- Use the **[Celestecord Report Service](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdS313fobbfUxKQOHgoTLRbK-TR9PdkWH3ZjPp9s9lTGavHgg/viewform?usp=sf_link)** to fill out and send a (optionally anonymous) report to us.
- Open a ticket in <#962025876407590912> to directly discuss it with the team.

Ban appeals can be submitted through this form if needed. Bookmarking or otherwise saving it elsewhere is recommended.
